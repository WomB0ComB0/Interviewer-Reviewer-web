# Soft Skill Bot

## Inspiration

In today's job market, possessing both technical and soft skills like communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities is crucial for success. However, many job seekers struggle to showcase their soft skills during the interview process, and employers often lack effective tools to assess and train their employees in these areas. That's why the SoftSkillBoost, formerly Team InterviewerReviewer and Team Recruiter Skills, projects were born - to provide innovative and comprehensive tools to bridge this gap and help job seekers and employers succeed.

## What it does

InterviewerReviewer is an AI-powered tool that simulates a natural feeling interview environment and evaluates interviewee's responses while providing constructive feedback. The tool assesses not just what candidates say, but also how they say it and how they respond to difficult questions. Additionally, InterviewerReviewer offers interview education resources to help candidates prepare and present their best selves during the interview process. The ultimate goal of InterviewerReviewer is to help job seekers improve their communication skills and increase their chances of success in landing their dream job.

Team Recruiter Skills is an educational tool that helps job seekers understand the mindset of an interviewer and improve their job search strategies. It provides a series of interactive modules that teach job seekers how to research job openings, tailor their resume and cover letter to specific job postings, prepare for interviews, and negotiate job offers. Team Recruiter Skills also offers resources for employers to assess and train their employees in these areas. The ultimate goal of Team Recruiter Skills is to help job seekers and employers understand each other's perspectives and succeed in the hiring process.

## How we built it

InterviewerReviewer utilizes advanced technologies such as Cohere NLP API and Google Cloud speech-to-text to create a natural feeling interview environment that simulates real-life situations. Meanwhile, Team Recruiter Skills utilizes advanced technologies such as React and Firebase to provide a seamless user experience. Both projects were built with a user-centric approach, ensuring that the interfaces are easy to navigate and utilize.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we faced was integrating the various technologies and ensuring that they worked seamlessly together. Additionally, we had to ensure that the user experience was intuitive and engaging, which required a lot of user testing and feedback.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud to have developed two innovative tools that address key challenges in the modern job market. InterviewerReviewer provides job seekers with a safe and low-stakes environment to practice their interview skills and gain confidence, ultimately increasing their chances of success. Team Recruiter Skills provides job seekers and employers with a comprehensive toolset to navigate the hiring process and improve their chances of success.

## What we learned

Throughout this project, we learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration in building successful tools. We also learned about the power of advanced technologies such as AI and React in creating seamless and engaging user experiences.

## What's next for SoftSkillBoost

We plan to continue improving and expanding both InterviewerReviewer and Team Recruiter Skills, incorporating new technologies and features to provide even more value to job seekers and employers. Our ultimate goal is to become the go-to platform for enhancing soft skills and improving workplace dynamics in the hiring process.
